    "### after runing program the program will ask for commands \n",
    "### There are two commands\n",
    "### 1. remind < time in seconds > < message to be Reminded >\n",
    "### This command sets a reminder for n second and displayes the message given for example command \"remind 30 go to school\" will remind message go to school after 30 seconds \n",
    "## Note : Minutes must be converted into seconds before entering\n",
    "### 2. remindword < Time in seconds >\n",
    "### This command will provide a new word with its meaning Periodically after a set time example command \" remindword 120\" this will provide  a word with its meaning every two minutes\n",
    "## Note : This command only works with active internet connetion         "
